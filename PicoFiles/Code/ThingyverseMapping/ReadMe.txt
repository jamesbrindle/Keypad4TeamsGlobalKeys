# Keypad4Teams

The keypad should be ready to use as is, however the default is that it will only work while a MS Team call window has focus.

In order for the keypad to work Globally (whether other windows have focus or not), you must install a small application on your computer which will run in the background.
This program is a Window handler, and will bring the Teams call window to the front when using the keypad.

To install: Copy the 'WindowsInstaller.zip' file to your computer and extract it. Then run the 'Setup.exe'.. Done!

Enjoy!

This uses the original key mapping from the files on: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4883188

The original key mapping didn't work for me, however, someone requested thge code.py with the original mapping.
